General Assembly: Choose Your Destiny - Project Summary

Overview

"General Assembly: Choose Your Destiny" is a game designed to simulate coding lab experiences, where players choose to code themselves, copy someone else's work, or use AI to generate code. The project was a collaborative effort with the following contributions:

Team Contributions

Cody: Led the coding efforts, implementing core functionality with real-time input from Ashley and Ricky.

Ashley: Provided critical feedback, notably identifying that dynamically generated buttons in JavaScript were causing issues. Suggested moving button implementation to HTML, inspired by the DOM lab, which resolved the problem.

Ricky: Contributed ideas and feedback during development to shape the game's direction.

Development Process

The original concept was an interactive game guiding players through coding labs with three distinct choices: write original code, copy existing code, or use AI-generated code. However, the team, particularly myself, Cody, overcomplicated the initial codebase, leading to functionality issues. After Ashley's suggestion to shift button generation from JavaScript to static HTML, the team resolved key blockers, improving the game's stability.

Final Outcome

While the game does not include all the envisioned features due to time constraints and initial overcomplication, it is functional and meets the core objective of providing an interactive lab experience. The scrapped code from earlier iterations was preserved in app.js for reference.
